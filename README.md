# lightning-visualization
We had an interesting presentation about lighting strike by Dr. Zen Kawasaki.

Have a look at the presentation slides and the data files.

The challenge is to recreate the visualization on a 3D map view (for ex. google map).
Then process the lightning data and perform a re-play of the lightning strike in realtime and in slowmotion 
(this mean - you display the factor of what you slow the time with as you re-play the lightning strike).

Some thought:
- process data points to vector ?
- Process data on a fast cloud server ?

Do share your thoughts in this repository and create your own development branch as you clone the content!
